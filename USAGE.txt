This is instructions file for using the code of the project

1. To run the project code, simply run
python3 game.py

2. An intuitive interface will be displayed.
In this interface you will be able to set 2 agents for a single game of Halma.
For each agent you will choose (by entering input) its properties, for example, for Minimax agent you will choose depth,
time-limit per move, Evaluation Function etc.

3. For your convenience, as we concluded on the paper, the optimal agent we found is
depth-2 Iterative Deepening Alpha-Beta Agent with evaluation function: Euclidean(1), Lone-wolf(0.14)  (f1 in the menu)
